    "#  Conditionals and Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter focuses on controlling the \"flow\" of a program—making decisions with logic and repeating tasks with loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Conditionals (Making Decisions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditionals allow the program to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The if, elif, and else Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`if` statement**: The entry point. Checks a condition; if `True`, runs the indented block.\n",
    "- **`elif` (else if)**: Checks a new condition only if the previous `if` (or `elif`) was `False`. You can have multiple `elif` blocks.\n",
    "- **`else`**: The catch-all. Runs only if all preceding conditions were `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition_1:\n",
    "    # Runs if condition_1 is True\n",
    "elif condition_2:\n",
    "    # Runs if condition_1 is False AND condition_2 is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Runs if both are False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python uses **indentation** (whitespace) to define blocks of code.\n",
    "- Standard practice is **4 spaces**.\n",
    "- All lines in the same block must have the **exact same indentation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Boolean Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison Operators:\n",
    "- `==` (Equal to) vs. `=` (Assignment) — Be careful not to confuse these!\n",
    "- `!=` (Not equal to)\n",
    "- `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logical Operators:\n",
    "- `and`: `True` only if both sides are `True`.\n",
    "- `or`: `True` if at least one side is `True`.\n",
    "- `not`: Reverses the boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 Loops (Repetition)\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops allow you to repeat code efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. while Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function**: Repeats a block of code as long as a condition remains `True`.\n",
    "- **Best for**: When you don't know in advance how many times you need to loop (e.g., finding a solution by trial and error).\n",
    "- **Risk**: If the condition never becomes `False`, you create an **Infinite Loop** (use `Ctrl+C` to stop it).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. for Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function**: Iterates over a sequence (like a list, string, or array), assigning each item to a dummy variable one by one.\n",
    "- **Best for**: Iterating through data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Helpers:\n",
    "- `range(start, stop, step)`: Generates a sequence of integers.\n",
    "- `enumerate(sequence)`: Returns both the index (counter) and the value for each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Loop Control Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`break`**: Immediately terminates the loop and moves to the code following it.\n",
    "- **`continue`**: Skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps back to the top of the loop for the next item.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Loops vs. Arrays (Important!)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance**: Python `for` loops are relatively slow for heavy math.\n",
    "- **Best Practice**: Whenever possible, use **NumPy array operations** (vectorization) instead of loops. They are significantly faster (e.g., 100x faster) because they run in optimized C code.\n",
    "\n",
